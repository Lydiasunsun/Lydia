                    <p> Temari ball was introduced to Japan from China in the middle of the 6th century, and became
                        one
                        of the favorite toys of noble girls in the Kyoto area. From the 14th century, embroidery
                        elements were gradually added to Temari balls, using silk embroidery thread. In the mid-18th
                        century, due to the mass production of cotton thread, Temari balls wrapped with cotton
                        thread
                        really began to enter the lives of ordinary people.
                        <br> </br>
                        Temari ball is made by winding thread or cloth into a ball, positioning the ball with thread,
                        and finally embroidering different shapes on it.
