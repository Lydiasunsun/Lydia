          <p>Dear guests</p>
          <p>
            Thank you for choosing my retreat, I sincerely hope you will enjoy
            your time with me and other guests in the nature. You can practice
            yoga and meditation, breathe fresh air, live simple days, eat
            healthy organic food, pick up vegetables in the farm and cook in
            nature, boat, or watch ducks playing in the river, read by the
            river. Life is slow, simple and happy here. I'm inviting you to
            enjoy a weekend with us together here.
          </p>

          <p>OUR SPIRIT</p>
          <p>
            Slow down and reconnect with nature, with your own body and mind,
            and other people. In modern life, our thoughts are like jumping
            monkeys, making it hard to concentrate and efficient. Mindfulness
            meditation can help you focus on the present and enjoy the beauty of
            life better. Yoga practice can help you increase your body's
            flexibility and strength. The body and mind are closely related.
            Body flexibility will help increase your mind flexibility and
            creativity. Stronger body also enhance a stronger and braver mind
            and spirit.
